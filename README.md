# Predicting-the-risk-of-having-a-stroke-of-a-person---Machine-Learning
 

<p align="justify"> Welcome to the "Predicting the risk of having a stroke of a person - Machine Learning" repository! Here, we present a collaborative effort where a machine learning model was developed to predict the risk of stroke in individuals. Utilizing techniques such as Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Hyperparameter Tuning, our team explored data-driven approaches to identify potential risk factors for strokes. Our findings, showcased in a research paper, reflect our analytical skills and the effectiveness of teamwork in addressing complex healthcare challenges. </p>

Join us on this journey of leveraging machine learning for proactive stroke risk assessment.
